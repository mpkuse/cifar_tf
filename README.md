# Minimal Tensorflow Example - Cifar10

This is a minimal example showing usage of tensorflow to train cifar10. 
Make sure you have tensorflow correctly installed and running. 

`cifar_train.py` builds the computational graph for a simple convolutional network. Runs the gradient descent iterations and finally tests on the testing set.

In this repository, I am not including cifar-dataset. Please download it from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html. Download the cPickle-python version. 

Also make sure load_data.py works
